# Cutting

Allow 2 or 3 months to cut the fat while keeping the muscle. This is the fun part, but it's mentally tougher.

## Philosophy

Create a large calorie deficit while eating 200 grams of protein per day. This will cause your body to eat its own fat to make up for the deficit.

It's easier to just stay in ketosis. If you want real results, do it.

## Workouts

You should duplicate & adapt [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kWoa_W7le1Zh_3ufNy17Y8w4l0YEzz7ELM6V2n9-FOg/edit#gid=1514070884). Change the boxes in yellow.

The basic idea is:

* Lift 4x
* Cardio 6x, but mix it up

I listen to audiobooks while rucking, and sometimes also while lifting. It makes this more enjoyable.

## Nutrition

* Keto
* ~2k Calories
* High protein (200g / day)

### Specific Eating Schedule

  * 1/2 scoop of [Athletic Greens](https://athleticgreens.com/)

  * shake with water

* Breakfast:
  * 4 scrambled eggs
    * topped w/ mushrooms
    * also topped with parmesan cheese

* Lunch:
  * chicken breast + hamburger meat
  * avocado
  * a handful of lettuce

* Snack:
  * plant-based protein & water
    * I usually do a [flavored](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5YNWRT3/) one

* Dinner:
  * Usually skip it
  * If not, just do some shrimp or almonds or something
  * Maybe another cup of water + flax-seeds
  * Maybe snack on some 100% cacao dark chocolate (no sugar!!)

That's it, don't overthink it.
