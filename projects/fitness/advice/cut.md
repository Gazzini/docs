# Cutting

10 weeks, cut fat, keep muscle. This is the fun part, but it's mentally tougher.

## Philosophy

Create a large calorie deficit while eating 200 grams of protein per day. This will cause your body to eat its own fat to make up for the deficit.

If you can create a 1,200 calorie deficit, you can cut 1/3 lb per day.

Your body is better at eating fat when in ketosis. So, it's much easier just do strict keto.

## Workouts

You should duplicate & adapt [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kWoa_W7le1Zh_3ufNy17Y8w4l0YEzz7ELM6V2n9-FOg/edit). Change the boxes in yellow.

The basic idea is:

* Lift 4x
* Cardio 6x, but mix it up

I listen to audiobooks while rucking, and sometimes also while lifting. It makes this more enjoyable.

## Nutrition

* Keto
* ~2k Calories
* High protein (200g / day)

### Specific Eating Schedule

* 6am:
  * 1/2 scoop of [Athletic Greens](https://athleticgreens.com/)
  * 1 scoop of [bland, plant-based protein](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0021F8HH0)
  * shake with water

* Breakfast:
  * 4 scrambled eggs
    * topped w/ mushrooms
    * also topped with parmesan cheese
  * [bacon](/fitness/advice/meals/bacon)
  * avocado

* [Smoothie](/fitness/advice/meals/smoothie_cut)

* Lunch:
  * [chicken breast + hamburger meat](/fitness/advice/meals/meat_prep)
  * avocado
  * a handful of lettuce

* Snack:
  * plant-based protein & water
    * I usually do a [flavored](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5YNWRT3/) one

* Dinner:
  * Usually skip it
  * If not, just do some shrimp or almonds or something
  * Maybe another cup of water + flax-seeds
  * Maybe snack on some 100% cacao dark chocolate (no sugar!!)

That's it, don't overthink it. You got this!
