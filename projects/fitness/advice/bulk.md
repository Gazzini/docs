# Bulking

10 weeks to get big. Don't be afraid. This is the first half of the bulk-cut journey.

## Philosophy

You gain muscle _much faster_ when in a caloric surplus, and carbs help you train harder anyways.

Lift heavy, minimize cardio, eat a ton. Don't take shortcuts.

## Workouts

Duplicate [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VwsLI8ZCy5Im9O7YzSCyWH_mRaq506If49B1-c7QTgo), adapt it to your schedule.

* Lift 4x (2 heavy, 2 medium)
* Only do cardio 2x / week, and _never_ after lifting.
