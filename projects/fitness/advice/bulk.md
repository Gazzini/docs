# Bulking

Allow 2 or 3 months to build lots of muscle, and don't be afraid of gaining a little fat. Getting shredded is a ~6 month journey. Don't take shortcuts.

## Program

Use [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kWoa_W7le1Zh_3ufNy17Y8w4l0YEzz7ELM6V2n9-FOg), adapt it to your schedule. I like to do front-squats on Fridays, and I throw in weighted pull-ups & lots of auxillary stuff.

TODO: put my actual bulk program on here.

I also paired it with extreme stretching exercises after lifting, abs 3 days, and core 2 days. (TODO: write down my complete workout).

Only do cardio 2x / week, and never _after_ lifting.

## Nutrition

* First thing in the morning, eat (or drink) 30g protein.
* Eat at least 200g protein / day
  * You need supplements to hit this target
    * 2 scoops plant-based protein
    * 1 or 2 scoops whey protein (any more destroys my bowels)
* Eat some veggies (chicken + rice + veggies is easy to prep in bulk)
* Don't shy a way from carbs
* Don't gorge yourself with milkshakes and oreos, unless you want to.

(TODO: specific bulking daily diet).
