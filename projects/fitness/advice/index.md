# Advice

If I can do this, then you can do it even better. I hope you find this actionable & inspiring... or that it provides a high-fidelity data point in your mental-map of how people optimize themselves.

## Specific

* [Bulking](/fitness/advice/bulk)

* [Cutting](/fitness/advice/cut)

* [Food tips](meals)

## General

* Be patient, work in 6-month phases. Build muscle for 10+ weeks, _then_ cut fat for 10+ weeks.

* _Always_ eat 200g protein / day. You will have to supplement with protein powder for this.

* Re-arrange your [environment](/fitness/home_gym) if possible.

* Make a specific plan.

* Change your mindset on suffering. Stop focusing on the destination, become the type of person who enjoys discipline.

* Consistency is king; this requires resolve.

* You will _always_ have injuries. Adapt.

## Opinions

* It's much easier to cut on keto
  * Reduced cravings
  * Consistent energy levels

* Pre-workout seems dangerous

* Plant-protein is easier on the stomach than whey
  * Mix it up throughout the day!
    * 1 scoop of whey
    * 2 scoops of plant-stuff

* Stop binge drinking alcohol

* Stop drinking sugar

* Eat a big breakfast

* When cutting, if you just go to bed hungry then you're 90% there.
