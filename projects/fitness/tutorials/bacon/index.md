# Bacon

Look, the bacon packaging makes no sense. Terrible cooking UX.

So, I found a system that minimizes stress:

1) Get a week's worth of bacon.

2) Cut all of it in half

3) Put it in a big zip-loc bag, in the fridge

4) Pull out 1/2 pack whenever you need bacon (works great for a family of 4).
