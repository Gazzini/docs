# Nutrition

For years, I just worked out a lot & trusted that the score would take care of itself.

Recently, I've been more intentional about nutrition & loved it.

## Cutting

### Breakfast

#### Smoothie

Lots of these:

* Ice
* Water
* Flax Seed
* Blueberry Whey Protein (no sugar)
* Cinnamon
* Greek Yogurt

Tiny splashes of these:

* Blueberries (2 berries)
* Milk (1 tsp)
