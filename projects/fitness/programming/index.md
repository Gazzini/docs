# Programming

For years, I would just work out whenever I was stressed. If you can push past some initial point of joint-pain, it's very cathartic.

As I got a _little bit_ smarter about programming, my results have improved drastically.

It's fun & important to try all kinds of stuff.

Am I bulking or cutting?
