# Projects

My projects never have a clear _end_. If I think it's worthwhile, I'll keep going.

There is nothing formal about this decision. Rational systems are important _at scale_, but it's a mistake to [over-apply](https://metarationality.com/stem-fluidity-bridge) them to our personal lives. Human intuition is very powerful, so I'm willfully throwing time & resources behind [open-ended exploration](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/01/06/quit-your-job/).

I'll start & quit many projects, but never apply anything like a [multi-arm bandit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit). Based on intuition alone, I'll sometimes pursue a project _for years_ with no provable ROI.

To be completely honest, I simply pray for wisdom and continually ask "What is God's will?" as I'm deciding how to invest my most precious resource -- time.

I take side-projects more seriously than most people. They evolve over the years.
Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at <http://localhost:3000/>.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
