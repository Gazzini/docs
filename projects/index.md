# Welcome

Human intuition is powerful, so I dedicate time & resources to [open-ended exploration](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/01/06/quit-your-job/). I'll sometimes pursue a project _for years_ with no definite ROI.

I simply pray for wisdom and continually ask "What is God's will?" as I'm deciding how to invest my most precious resource -- time.
