# Welcome

I throw irresponsible amounts of time & money behind projects as a form of [open-ended exploration](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/01/06/quit-your-job/). I often spend years pursuing projects with no apparent value.

I simply pray for wisdom and continually ask "What is God's will?" as I'm deciding how to invest my most precious resource -- time. I'm open-sourcing my mental-map via this website; I dare you to do better. Go ahead, [fork it](https://github.com/gazzini/docs)!
