# Welcome

Intuition is powerful, so I intentionally spend time & resources on [open-ended exploration](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/01/06/quit-your-job/). I often spend years pursuing projects with no apparent value.

I simply pray for wisdom and continually ask "What is God's will?" as I'm deciding how to invest my most precious resource -- time.
