# Philosophy

My projects never have a clear _end_. If I think it's worthwhile, I'll keep going.

There is nothing formal about this decision. Rational systems are important _at scale_, but it's a mistake [over-apply](https://metarationality.com/stem-fluidity-bridge) them to our personal lives. Human intuition is very powerful, and it's important to create space to throw time & resources behind [open-ended exploration](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/01/06/quit-your-job/).

I'll try & quit many projects, but never apply anything like a [multi-arm bandit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit). Based on intuition alone, I'll sometimes pursue a project for years with no provable ROI.

To be completely honest, I simply pray for wisdom and continually ask "What is God's will?" as I'm deciding how to invest my most precious resource -- time.
