# Cryptocurrency

Economic efficiency is important... and also weird. The idea of storing "value" to spend later is a problem we humans invented for ourselves, but it matters enough to sweat the details.

I'm more of a BTC maximalist every day, as I'm continually surprised by _how short_ of the liberterian utopia every new project seems to fall... and I'm mostly uninterested in financial speculation.

## Projects

### Coinbase

I've worked here full-time since October 2021.

### Helium

I ran 30+ Helium hotspots on my friends rooftops for a few years. It went really well for a while.

### Staking

I ran nodes for a bunch of different proof-of-stake blockchains. I learned a lot about incentives and made a lot of money (almost).

### StakeRiver

I helped build a POKT staking pool, and at one point we had 40 dedicated machines in Hetzner (in Germany). We were running nodes for 10+ different blockchains and serving data in real-time to end users. It was fun to game the performance using web2 hacks (Cloudflare edge workers, etc...).

But, the price of POKT crashed, and I couldn't [save it](https://forum.pokt.network/t/weight-session-selection-by-staked-amount/2935) in time. Also, because of how the frontend was structured for developers, POKT had to censor OFAC uncompliant transactions... which is antithetical to the point of decentralized infra.

But, I did make [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otdzapm1RCk).
