# Writing

I want to become a good writer, so I need to write a lot.

I wrote essays for a few years, but I'm trying to do something more experimental next... stay tuned!

In the meantime, here are some of my favorites (full list in the sidebar):

* [I told you so](/writing/told_you_so)
* [Alignment](/writing/alignment)
* [Pure Programming](/writing/pp)
* [Caricatures](/writing/authentic)
