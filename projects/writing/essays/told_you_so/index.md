# I Told You So

Saying "I told you so" should make me feel stupid, not smart. What I'm really saying is: "I _knew_ the truth, but I wasn't convincing enough to make my knowledge useful."

Building good intuition is only half the battle -- next, I must _apply_ it. This often involves persuading others, which is a very different skill. If I don't practice this skill, then I'll become pessimistic & dissenting over time.

If 1 jerk won't listen to me, that's his problem.

If the world is full of jerks that won't listen to me... that's my problem.
