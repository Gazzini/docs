# Pooldash

I'm building [pooldash](https://pooldash.com). It's niche software that helps people chemically balance their swimming pools.

I started trying to build a lifestyle business, but now it's currently some mix of performance-art & altruism. I open-sourced it & have helped ~8 people land their first tech jobs.

I've been building some version of this since 2010.

## Principles

- Build what users ask for
- Build a product I enjoy working on
- Go deep, not wide

That's the whole strategy -- time to execute!

## Progress

View project updates [here](/pooldash/timeline). I've got a few thousand free users & no business model to speak of.

## Past Projects

View [past iterations](/pooldash/graveyard), starting 12 years ago.
